# The Three User Groups We Serve

1. **Arcade Players** – casual gamers who want fast, cheap, on-chain retro games  
2. **Game Developers** – indie studios & solo devs who want to ship WASM games with instant revenue  
3. **Vault Investors** – U.S. accredited persons with capital-gains tax exposure looking for QOZ real-estate

Two separate front-ends. Two separate revenue models. Zero user-story confusion.

# 1. EverArcade – For Players & Developers (Q1 2026)

**For Players**
- No gas, <1¢ per game
- Pay/win with any XRPL token via pathfinding
- Own your skins, high scores, tournament prizes

**For Game Developers** (the real moat)
- One-click deploy from GitHub → live on Evernode HotPocket cluster
- Automatic 70/30 or 80/20 revenue split (dev keeps majority)
- Built-in Xaman wallet payments + NFT minting hooks
- Zero server ops – we run the hosts, you just ship .hp bundles

**Business model**
- 1–2% platform rake on all wagers
- Premium listing slots & dev tools subscriptions
→ $500k–$3M ARR at 10–25k DAU (proven on other chains)

**Tech (same for players & devs)**
| Layer            | Tech                          | Status today                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Game execution   | Evernode HotPocket (.hp)      | 5 titles running on AlphaNet  |
| State/leaderboards | Xahau Hooks + host disk     | Live                          |
| Assets           | IPFS / nft.storage            | All art pinned                |
| Frontend         | everarcade.games (Vercel)     | Live today                    |

# 2. EverVault – For Accredited U.S. Investors Only (Q2 2026)

Separate domain, separate UX, separate compliance flow.

**Value prop**
- Convert capital-gains exposure into tokenized QOZ real-estate
- Defer 100% of tax today
- Hold 10 years → new gains 100% tax-free

**One-click flow**
1. Connect Xaman at evervault.me
2. ZK proof confirms accreditation
3. Pick a building (Brooklyn multifamily, Austin tech campus, etc.)
4. Atomic batch transaction → 10-year Escrow + MPT shares (blackholed issuer)

**Business model**
0.5–1% annual management fee on TVL  
$10M TVL → $50–100k ARR (scales linearly)

**Tech (completely isolated from arcade)**
| Piece            | Tech                            | Status today                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Accreditation    | ZK proof → oracle               | Stub working                  |
| 10-year lock     | Native XRPL Escrow              | Tested                        |
| Shares           | MPT + blackholed issuer         | Compiles today                |
| Valuation        | Evernode + Chainlink oracles    | In progress                   |
| Frontend         | evervault.me (Vercel)           | Live today                    |

# Current traction (December 2025)

- Evernode host live (24/24 leases, reputation building)
- everarcade.games + evervault.me live on Vercel
- 5 arcade titles running on AlphaNet
- Vault contract compiles & executes on Xahau AlphaNet
- Zero external funding

# Grant Ask – $250,000

| Use of funds                   | Amount | Timeline |
|--------------------------------|--------|----------|
| Arcade – 5 launch titles + dev portal | $100k | Q1 2026 |
| Vault – ZK + oracle + legal audit    | $100k | Q2 2026 |
| Shared compliance & marketing        | $50k  | Ongoing |

We ship regardless.  
The grant just lets us open the developer floodgates and the vault TVL pipe at the same time.

everarcade.games → players + developers  
evervault.me      → accredited investors only  

Three user groups. Two products. One stack. Zero confusion.

Let’s go.
